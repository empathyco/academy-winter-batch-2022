# Week 10: Finishing integration :wrench:
In this week we worked on fixing several parts of the backend and finishing the integration with our frontend fellows.
First of all, we spotted a little problem regarding the JSON output of the API. We detected that the character array was not properly formatted, so we talked to our Front mates and told us that the problem was already spotted (and fixed).

Even with this known, we tried to fix it anyways (pride :smiling_face_with_tear:), but as the performance got noticeably worse, we had to rollback the changes to avoid further trouble in indexing and integration.

Apart from this, we worked on our Areas presentation and its script :man_in_tuxedo:
