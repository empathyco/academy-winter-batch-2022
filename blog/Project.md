# Our group multidisciplinary project

## Introduction

During the next months and guided by [Empathy.co](https://empathy.co/)'s values, this batch aims to collaborate with [JaimeObregon/subvenciones](https://github.com/JaimeObregon/subvenciones) project.

## The objectives

1. Engage the dataset in our search engine, being fast, reliable and easy to use.
2. Create an amazing webpage.
3. Analyze, compare and build insights doing fancy "data magic".
4. Some nice to have optimal developments to keep the website relevant and the project alive.
5. Create awareness and motivate the community.

## User personas
After a process of brainstorming, we extracted the main functionalities to be covered on our project. From these, we identified 6 different roles:

1. Journalists
2. Bidhunters
3. Common people with genuine interest
4. Bid requesters which want to check if they missed a grant
5. Developers and students that want to know how we implemented everything
6. Public administration employees which want a faster and joyful search service

The brainstorming process and the extraction of personas is described in the following image:

We accorded, then, that our project was going to be focused to on the general public: People who has interest on seaching for given grants only for curiosity, or which want to consider how much money is given on grants in a specific area.

## Job to be done
The ultimate goal, what we want to achieve with this project is no more than continuing with Jaime Obregón's initiative in favor of transparency. We want to oversee all grant data, which otherwise could be obscure for the common people, and wrap it all up in a joyful experience for them.

## Design approach
Taking as reference the identified user personas, we decided to provide two different views in our project, these being:

### Search for visual, general data
As we stated earlier, the main goal of the project is to inform the general crowd. That's why we decided to build a customizable insights section so that people can display data visually.
This way, people can search according to certain filters, and get their data represented in a visual and joyful way.

### Search for specific data
User personas that have deep knowledge on grants or know very well what they are looking for might want to search for specific data rather than see insights. With this in mind, we are going to provide a classic search service in our web so that information on individual grants can be retrieved.

## Spicy features :hot_pepper:
We really want to make our project a joyful one. Here are some features that differ from what we usually do and that can provide value to the final user:

## Progress
### Sprint 1 
- Careful ellaboration of a detailed design
- Contracts between teams in order to gain independence
### Sprint 2
- Frontend for the discovery section
- First steps with the search service (problems found!)
- Data cleaning
- Creation of a basic crawler
### Sprint 3
- Optimization of the crawler
- Creation of a functional search service
- Deployment of the service using a (huge) bash script



### Warming up
To warm up, we solved the [challenge proposed by Jaime Obregón](https://contratosdecantabria.es/wtf/#making-of) and had a lot of fun solving it. We were amazed by the result!
