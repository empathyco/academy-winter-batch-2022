# Week 6: Do not forget about Relevancy :smirk_cat:
Now that our APIs are able to perform operations like indexing and searching, it is the time to talk about something that cannot be forgotten: Relevancy. The data retrieved from an specific query, has to be relevant, according to some parameters (:mage:).

## Exercise
We reached a key point in the development of our project: with our APIs, documents can be indexed and queries can be done. But it is true that our hits are not as accurate as we would want... üòø It was clear that some adjustments regarding how we boost the results have to be done. It has to be CLEAR that if we look for Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy VI has to be our FIRST result üìù.

Besides this, there are some good news! This week was marked by the begining of the integration of our APIs with Front path ü•≥. So we had to be very kind with our front folks and gave them as many documentation and instructions as we could so they did not struggle setting up all the environment. 

Finally, we did some adjustments to our boosting, in the most optimistic way (from our point of view, it could be that is not the best üòì), and now queries are working as it is supposed to ü§ñ.
