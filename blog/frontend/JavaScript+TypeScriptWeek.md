# JavaScript and Typescript
We went through an introduction of JavaScript and TypeScript in order to increase our web development skills. Moreover, we cover how that knowledge could be applied to the DOM and we were introduced to some tools to feel powerful web engineers.

## Javascript queries, functional methods & find the suspect
(Autonomos work)

Given a base project with different data samples, complete the queries in the comments and check they return the expected result.  

When finished, try to implement some functions that were used in the previous exercise or that are in the [JS Web Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) web. 

Finally, complete the exercise given on the "sospechoso.js" file.
