## WEEK 2.
A script about what we did on the data path along the second week 

--------------------------------
## Week from 28  March to 1 April.

At the beginning of the week we started the second Module related with Google analytics and Google Tag Manager(GTM).

Eva Gonzalez from the analytics path  gave us an overview about Universal Analytics(GA3) Google analytics 4(GA4) and GTM, besides she proposed that we could go further and complete 3 courses:

-3 courses of GA3(https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/).

-GA4 course (https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=6431-google-analytics-4&utm_campaign=redirect&utm_source=analytics-academy&utm_medium=banner).

-GTM course(https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/5).

Along this week we did the courses and we wanted to go deeply, so we tried to connect the website of our frontend fellows with Google analytics.

Finally, at the end of the week Eva proposed to us to set up of own website with Google analytics.
