## Testing the Rick and Morty app developed the previous week
(Autonomous work) <!-- Comment wheter if it is autonomous or group work -->
This week, our autonomuos work consisted on implementing some unitary tests of the Rick and Morty exercise implemented for the previous week, which was a simple application using an external API.
Tough the week was shorter because Easter holidays took Thursday and Friday away from us, we still met the objectives.
