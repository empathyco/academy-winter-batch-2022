## Exercise
At the beginning of the week we started the second Module related with Google analytics and Google Tag Manager(GTM).

Eva Gonzalez from the analytics path gave us an overview about Universal Analytics(GA3) Google analytics 4(GA4) and GTM, besides she proposed that we could go further and complete 3 courses.

Along this week we did the courses and we wanted to go deeply, so we tried to connect the website of our frontend developers fellows with a Google analytics and GTM accounts.

Finally, at the end of the week Eva proposed to us to set up a new website with Google analytics and GTM.
