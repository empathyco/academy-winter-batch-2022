# Week 9: TSV merging last touches and hands on suggestions
This week we had to finish the merging of the tsv files and the mapping, for allowing front and data to work with it. 

Then, we got our hands on the suggestions, although we could not get it to work. Apparently, the java client API that we use for elastic had some bugs :bug: with the Json parser, which prevented us from implementing both term and phrase suggestions. 

We did not have a session this week, since we had our hands full with the merging and suggestions. Nonetheless, we had a review meeting with Jesús, in which we shared our concerns with the API bugs :ladybug: and discussed the contents of the extra session that we where going to have next week.

We agreed that a docker+kubernetes session was on point, since we feel that it is an interesting matter and we lack expertise on those technologies. :anchor:
