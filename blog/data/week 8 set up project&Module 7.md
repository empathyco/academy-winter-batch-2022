2. how to work in team for a project
3. How set up a script with the functions needed

At the beginning of the week we started IMDb project from the data point of view.

All the academy teams leaded by Jose (https://github.com/jllorian)
worked together in a Miro template and set up the jobs to do, and who should do them.

We worked also in a Python´s script that could manage the data and get the insights for the project, within the data team we created a GitHub repository for that purpose.

## Exercise

1. How to manage google sheet 
2. How to adequate the graphics for the analysis

We used differents kinds of plots depending on different kinds od datasets. in the first exercise we had 7 clients with the records of their top values, and we basically represent them in a bar chart and in a Pareto chart for a descriptive analysis.


In the second exercises we had a time series with diferent KPI´s and we had to get some insights about it.

It was especially relevant how to adjust the insights and plots to only 2 slides cause in the most of times it is what a coustomer want.


### With the CSVs that you have at your disposal in the link, create two different visualizations. Draw conclusions by client and as a whole. Write a 10 lines report with the conclusions (include in the annexes the two graphs per client).

### Create a presentation in Google Slides with the graphs linked from Google Sheet (data, in the link). The presentation will have 4 pages(1st with the Empathy logo, 2nd with the data visualizations, 3rd with conclusions,  4th with the “Thank you” slide.):
