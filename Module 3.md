# Week 3 - Module 3
In order to put in practice the concepts taught in the previous module, Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Google Analytics (GA4) where implemented in a demonstration website. The main objective of this module is to be able to create functional tags, measure them and track certain events happening on the website within the Google environment.

## Setting up GA4 & GTM
First of all, the demonstration website was created implementing a template from Free Website Templates (https://freewebsitetemplates.com) into the hosting Netlify (both services where free). After setting up the pertinent GA4 and GTM accounts, the snippet code generated by GTM was pasted in the website html archives. These html snippet codes contain the container ID and lets the website be recognised by the Google tools.

## Integration of GA4
Having finished the GTM website integration different tags where created to be measured by GA4.
