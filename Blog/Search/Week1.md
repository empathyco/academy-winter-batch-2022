**Key learning points**
1. How to integrate SpringBoot with a ElasticSearch container running
2. Manage ElasticSearch Java API and integrate it with a valid ElasticSearch engine version
3. Testing with Mockito
4. Use Docker
5. Use SDKManager

## Exercise
After an initial brief meeting with our mentors of the Search team, we had to create a basic API, _/search_, as kind of a showcase of all these technologies working together; Just a simple reponse for a simple request, which shown the correct integration between the API REST in Spring and the ElasticSearch Docker container running.
Apart from this, we had to develop the corresponding tests with Mockito.
