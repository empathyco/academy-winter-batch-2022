**Key learning points**
1. Good manage of Python for cleaning, and join diferent datasets.
2. Analytic POV for getting the insights needed.
3. How to manage Python beyond of data libraries for being able to make an API.

##  Development
After cleaning all our different tsv, merging and expanding them when was necessary, we got the insights that we needed and we saved them into a csv or json file for sending to our frontend mates.

Once we got all done we made 2 slides for visualizing all the process for the project presentation.

Besides we tried to make an API on Python, but we had some problems since we are using Anaconda environment, so I hope soon we can make it.
