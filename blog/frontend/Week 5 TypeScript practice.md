## Exercise
(Autonomous work) <!-- Comment wheter if it is autonomous or group work -->
The exercise purposed for this week was taking the [Type Challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) and complete everyone we could without looking in the solutions (or at least trying to solve ourselves before looking them). Only the easy challenges were mandatory. However, we could go further if we wanted to.
