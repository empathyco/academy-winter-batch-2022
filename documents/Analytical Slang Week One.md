## WEEK 1

On the first week at the Data Path of the Academy, Eva Gonz√°lez thought us about the importance of digital analytics metrics, introduced us to the DIKW model, explained what KPIs are, showed us some analytics slang and analytics processes. With this introduction Eva gave us a first view of the things that are going to be relevant in our every day.

As a task she told us to define a funnel for the empathy search process, select a web site you like and try to define goals and KPIs for it, and check some webs and try to find and see the analytics hits.
