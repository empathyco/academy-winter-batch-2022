## Exercise
At the beginning of the week we started the fifth Module related with Python.

Denise Cuervo from the analytics path gave us an overview about Python and she proposed that we could go further and complete some exercises.

Along this week we did the task related with module 4, we learnt how to use the Playbord with an exercise as we did with Elastic, Postman and Imsomnia.

We needed Sara´s help so we did another meeting on Thursday in which she teached us about Imnsomnia and Elastic, after that we could finished our exercises.

Finally at the end of the week we started to getting used with python and reviewing the Python´s scripts and material.
